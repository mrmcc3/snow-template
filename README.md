### snow-template

My naive attempt at a template for a progressive web app that uses:

* Snowpack to manage web dependencies, tree shaking
* React
* React Router v6. 
* Workbox. For generating the service worker.
* Tailwind + TailwindUI for component styling.

The [result][result] has boilerplate routes, and a tailwindUI "new version
available" banner for updates.
